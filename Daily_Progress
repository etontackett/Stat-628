Daily Progress Logs:
Day 1:
-We are currently running the EDA process on the dataset and looking at the modelling tips. We suspect that for businesses open less than 20 months, their FICO score may matter a lot more than businesses open for more than 20 months.
-Preliminary EDA suggests that the stress predictor may not be useful in our analysis.
-We are interested in defining a new variable (Num_Delinquent/Num_CreditLines) to get a ratio of delinquent credit lines to total credit lines
-Creating indicator/binary variables for the NACIS and CorpStructure data
